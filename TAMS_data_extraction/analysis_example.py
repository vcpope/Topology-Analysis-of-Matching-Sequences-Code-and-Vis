# To run in terminal:

# function wth combinations:
# # Transcripts
# from itertools import combinations
# from transcriptseqanalysis import combo_extractMatches
# shownum = 5 # number of shows 
# transcript_files = your_transcript_files # list of .srt filenames
# audio_files = your_audio_files # .wav files the same order as transcript files
# data_type = 'Transcript' # other option is 'TranscriptScript' 
# perfID = which_performer
#for x,y in combinations(range(shownum), 2):  # 2 for pairs, 3 for triplets, etc
#    combo_extractMatches(transcript_files[x], transcript_files[y],

# # If matching to transcripts to a script, no need to use combinations:
# shownum = 5 # number of shows
# transcript_files = your_transcript_files 
# audio_files = your_audio_files # in the same order as transcript files
# data_type = 'TranscriptScript' # other option is 'Transcript'
